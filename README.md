# Salary Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts an employee’s **salary based on years of experience** using **Simple Linear Regression**.  
It is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that demonstrates how regression models work.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts salary using one independent variable:
- Years of Experience → Salary

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- Simple Linear Regression

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Experience | Years of experience |
| Salary | Salary amount |

---

## ⚙️ Model Workflow
1. Load the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train the Linear Regression model
4. Predict salary for test data
5. Evaluate model using:
   - R² Score
   - Adjusted R² Score
6. Visualize regression line

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- **R² Score**: Measures model accuracy
- **Adjusted R²**: Adjusted for number of features

---

## ▶ How to Run the Project
```bash
python linear_regression.py
```
